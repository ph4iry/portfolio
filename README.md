# portfolio (phaedra's space) 💫

This is my portfolio site! It was bootstrapped with `create-r3f-app` and was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://react.dev), [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction), and [(Framer) Motion](https://motion.dev), with 3D assets that were designed in [Spline](https://spline.design). It's space themed (in tune with my enjoyment for stars).

Explore the site, and enjoy Phaedra's Space! 🪐
